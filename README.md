# Digital-Dice-8051
A digital dice implemented using the 8051 microcontroller, developed as a project for the MPMC course at VIT Chennai. Features random number generation with seven-segment display output and push-button interaction.

## 📌 Project Overview

The digital dice simulates the rolling of a physical dice by generating a random number (1 to 6) when a button is pressed. The output is shown on a seven-segment display. This project addresses the biases found in physical dice, offering a fair and programmable alternative.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Generate random numbers from 1 to 6 using the 8051.
- Display output on a 7-segment display.
- Provide an unbiased and compact dice alternative.
- User input via push button.

## ⚙️ Components Used

- 8051 Microcontroller
- Push-button Switch
- Seven-Segment Display
- Resistors, Capacitors
- Power Supply (5V)
- Proteus for circuit simulation

## 🔍 Report

The final project report is available [here](./MPMC_report.pdf)

## 🔮 Future Work

- Add LCD output in place of 7-segment for better visibility.
- Enable selection of dice sides (e.g., D4, D6, D10).
- Use a better random seed for improved randomness.
